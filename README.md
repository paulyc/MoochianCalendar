# Definitions
Moochian Epoch: July 21, 2017 Gregorian = day 0, Moochian Era 0 (ME0) (Time taken as 09:57 EDT (UTC-4) per https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/888442749342580737)

Le Fin de Mooch: July 31, 2017 Gregorian = day 10, ME0, = day 0, ME1 (11:57 EDT per https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/892095844341731328)

Moochian Period: 11 mean solar days

Fine Moochian Period (time between official @FoxNews announcement of appointment and dismissal): 11.080555555... mean solar days

Noted to be inclusive of Appointment and Dismissal days, though it seems likely
that pay was only requisitioned beginning on the 25th giving a Moochian Period of
one week, and that would just be boring, so we'll go with the commonly used
social media meme definition.

# Metric (SI) prefixes

### We shall have to hope the unit M is not too easily confused with M for Molarity, but considering the Mooch base unit is in time, seconds, and the Molarity base unit is in space, Liters^-3, I think not, but rate of concentration change could potentially be expressed as the partial derivative of concentration with respect to a function of Mooches, dM/dM now wouldn't that be fun?

1 DM (daM) = 1 dekaMooch = 10 Moochian Periods (MP) = 11e1 M = 110 solar days

1 hM = 1 hectoMooch = 100 MP = 11e2 M = 1100 solar days (3.0116 Julian years)

1 kM = 1 kiloMooch = 1000 MP = 11000 solar days (30.116 Julian years)

1 MM = 1 megaMooch = 1000000 MP = 11000000 solar days (30116 Julian years)

# Future Work
Provide more practical subdivisions of the Fine Moochian Period, e.g., cM, mcM, nM, etc.
