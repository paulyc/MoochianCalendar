# MoochianCalendar
Mooch - n. inf. A unit of time equal to 11 solar days

# WTFinfo
Anthony Scaramucci, nicknamed "The Mooch", is an American financier, entrepreneur, and political consultant who briefly served as the White House Director of Communications from July 21 to July 31, 2017. 

# Definitions
July 21, 2017 (Appointment) Gregorian = Moochian Epoch = Moochian Period 0 (MP0)

July 31, 2017 (Dismissal) Gregorian = Moochian Period 1 (MP1)

Noted to be inclusive of Appointment and Dismissal days, though it seems likely
that pay was only requisitioned beginning on the 25th giving a Moochian Period of
one week, and that would just be boring, so we'll go with the commonly used
social media meme definition.

# Metric (SI) prefixes

1 DM (daM) = 1 dekaMooch = 10 Moochian Periods (MP) = 11e1 M = 110 solar days

1 hM = 1 hectoMooch = 100 MP = 11e2 M = 1100 solar days (3.0116 Julian years)

1 kM = 1 kiloMooch = 1000 MP = 11000 solar days (30.116 Julian years)

1 MM = 1 megaMooch = 1000000 MP = 11000000 solar days (30116 Julian years)

# Future Work
Add precision by calculating the precise times of Appointment and Dismissal, thus possibly providing
a Fine Moochian Period and more practical subdivisions thereof.
