# Definitions
Moochian Epoch: July 21, 2017 Gregorian = day 0, Moochian Era 0 (ME0)

Le Fin de Mooch: July 31, 2017 Gregorian = day 10, ME0, = day 0, ME1

Moochian Period: 10 mean solar days = 950400s (SI)

# Metric (SI) prefixes

### We shall have to hope the unit M is not too easily confused with M for Molarity, but considering the Mooch base unit is in time, seconds, and the Molarity base unit is in space, Meters^-3, notwithstanding general relativity, I think not.

1 DM (daM) = 1 dekaMooch = 10 Moochian Periods (MP) = 11e1 M = 110 solar days

1 hM = 1 hectoMooch = 100 MP = 10e2 M = 1000 solar days (2y 269d 6h Julian)

1 kM = 1 kiloMooch = 1000 MP = 10000 solar days (27y 138d 6h Julian)

1 MM = 1 megaMooch = 1000000 MP = 10000000 solar days (27378y 185d 12h Julian)
